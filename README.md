            <h2>What is it?<h2>

            Connecting the dots is a <strong>platform<strong> (with the potential to become an app) to connect different people with different skills, with the aim to create a project together.
            The platform's main idea is to work with art and skills that can bring art to exposure.  

            <strong>Why art?<strong>
            Art is inspiration, is what takes life out of the obvious, it makes us dream, it enables us to find ourselves of to loose ourselves. It takes us out of our comfort zone. 

            During these times of the Corona crisis, artists were heavily affected with it, since their projects mostly depends on events, public spaces and interaction to be seen and exposed. We see this an opportunity to still bring art to people's life. How? Into a digital form. To accomplish that, we need to connect skill sets!


            <h3>1. What is <strong>Connecting the dots<strong> used for?<h3>

            <strong>Artists to expose their art<strong>
            Artists can upload some of their work and ask what kind of help/skills set they're searching for.

            <strong>People with skills sets<strong>
            People who have great skills and are fan of art can support & contribute. By seeing a art work they like, they can reach out the artist with a project idea. E.g. "I'm a video maker and we can do a film about your art work together"

            <strong>Project Managing enthusiastic<strong>
            You're not an artist, either a person with skills (such as graphic design, video producer, etc) but you're organised and good communicator! You can also step in here and be a project manager, working together with the skilled professional and the artist. Connect the dots too! 

            <h3>How is set up?<h3>
            This we need to figure it out together. The main idea is to build up a database, split into 3: 
            1. Artists
            2. People with skills set
            3. People who wants to connect the dots 
            We need to find a way that those 3 can connect. Who can find the person they're looking for? e.g. how to make sure a graphic designer finds an artist that needs some help to build a brand/logo/webpage? how to connect a video maker with a performance artist? 

            <h3>Team - who we are<h3>
            We are Ligia, Andre and Tim. André is teaching Tim and Ligia how to code and we want to build this amazing project together! André is a developer, Ligia works with Marketing and Tim is a sound engineer. 

            <h3>how can I join this project<h3>
            We definitely need people to help us building up and coding this platform. If you already have some webbed knowledge or wants to learn with us and build this platform with us, you're welcome to join! Other skills set as web designer is also welcome, as we'll need this platform to look cool!
